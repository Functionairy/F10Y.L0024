# F10Y.L0024
System.Text.Json package-based JsonOperator library.

By using the System.Text.Json package, System.Text.Json functionality can be used outside of .NET Core 3.0 and later versions, specifically in:

- .NET Standard 2.0 and later
- .NET Framework 4.6.2 and later
- .NET 8 and later


- ## F10Y.L0060

The F10Y.L0060 (.NET 6.0 foundation library) contains the same functionality, but based on the System.Text.Json that is built-in as of .NET 6.0.

The F10Y.L0060 library is the primary home of System.Text.Json functionality.
But this library, the F10Y.L0024 System.Text.Json package-based JSON functionality library, is provided as a clone for use in prior versions of .NET.
However, this library might be behind the F10Y.L0060 library.
